Implementation and analysis of toroidal raytracing agorithms for ORANGE and Monte Carlo transport simulations (15)

Monte Carlo random particle simulations are a key tool in understanding machines from nuclear reactors to particle detectors.
In order to trust a simulation of random particles in a structure, that structure must be accurately represented. 
The Oak Ridge Advanced Nested Geometry Engine, or ORANGE, aims to do just this, representing constructions for a wide range of particle simulations, including Celeritas, a code simulating high energy, standard model particle transport.
However, certain shapes, such as toroids, cannot yet be directly represented by the engine, a crucial setback in working with many teams whose machines can only be accurately represented using these shapes.
A set of raytracing algorithms were prototyped for Orange, including a set of different algorithms to solve the necessary quartic equations.
These algorithms were compared in the prototype to measure accuracy and precision across different test cases of toroid raytracing and general polynomials, allowing the best possible modeling of toroids in Orange.

Monte Carlo softwares, which simulate the behavior of random particles in a structure, are crucial from understanding nuclear reactors to particle detectors.
While traditional reactor cores can easily be represented by cylinders or planes, more advanced fission reactors, fusion reactors, and particle accelerators can often only be represented using more complex surfaces.
Toroids are of particular interest, being both common in these structures, and requiring quartic equations to fully resolve.
The Oak Ridge Advanced Nested Geometry Engine, or ORANGE, used for Monte Carlo softwares like Shift and Celeritas, must thus encompass these surfaces.
In our current efforts to support toroidal surfaces in ORANGE, we also seek to quantify the precision losses of different algorithms for toroid intersection.
We construct a python code to quantify these limitations and their implications for simulating toroidal surfaces.
Through this analysis, future monte carlo research may predict limits like the maximum simulatable size of a tokamak.
