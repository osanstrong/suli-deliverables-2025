Something about not resubmitting the 150 word abstract

The 150 word abstract does not go into Resolution
Abby will confirm what happens with the 300 word abstract, whether it goes with the report or separate

Planning to do individual site visits with every single one of us, Abby and a team of a couple of ORISE people.
Will receive an email asking for exact location so they can schedule a visit over what you've accomplished and everything. Fairly informal, just visit to see what you've been doing.

Email something will include all of the logos and the reference statement needed on the bottom.
Note: University Logo will also need to be included on the poster; make sure have university logo.

Make sure mentor reviews deliverables.

Submit deliverables first through RESolution, and then after that review submit them in WDTS

Ok yeah so the default is should do poster; The exeptions 

For those doing presentations, they'll email an example poster for the peer review.

For presentations, students put all logos on the top or very bottom, and then had section for acknowledgements, and at the end of the bottom of the presentation
